# Multiple-Linear-Regression-using-SPSS

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for understanding the relationship between Brand Consideration for Brand X and various factors related to brand perceptions. The goal is to identify the nature and strength of significant variables that influence Brand Consideration for Brand X.

## Problem Statement
Brand X is committed to enhancing consideration (likelihood of buying or leasing one) for its brand. To accomplish that goal, Brand X would like to understand the relationship between brand considerations and various factors related to brand perceptions.

## Solution
We conducted a Multiple Linear Regression analysis to determine the relationship between Brand Consideration (dependent variable) and ten brand attributes related to various factors related to brand perceptions (independent variables). Here are some key findings:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is a statistically significant linear relationship between Brand Consideration and the brand attributes.
- Multiple Correlation (R): A high positive correlation (R = 0.716) was found between Brand Consideration and the brand attributes.
- R-squared (RÂ²): Approximately 51.2% of the variance in Brand Consideration can be explained by the combined brand attributes.
- Adjusted R-squared: The adjusted R-squared (0.511) indicates that the model is not overly complex.
- Regression Equation: We derived a regression equation to represent the relationship between Brand Consideration and the brand attributes.
- Drivers of Commitment: We ranked the importance of each brand attribute based on beta weights. "A brand for me" was found to be the most important driver, followed by "Fits my style," "Proud to own," and others.
